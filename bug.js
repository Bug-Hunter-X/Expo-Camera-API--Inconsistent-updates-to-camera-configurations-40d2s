This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with custom camera configurations.  If you set certain properties like `flashMode` or `autoFocus`, and then try to change them later, the changes might not be reflected in the camera preview. This is particularly noticeable when switching between flash modes or trying to re-enable autoFocus after disabling it. The camera appears to retain the old settings despite the API calls.
